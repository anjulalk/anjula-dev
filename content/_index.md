# Hello there!ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Anjula Karunarathne, a software developer from Sri Lanka. I'm currently at [99x](https://99x.io), primarily working with C#, ASP.NET Core, JavaScript, and Azure Cloud. My focus revolves around developing large-scale enterprise applications, transforming ideas into functional solutions.

In my world beyond coding, I'm an explorer. I find inspiration from the world around me as I delve into the tech landscape. My goal is to make complex concepts tangible through gradual steps.

This platform serves as a window into my journey. While software occupies my work, this space offers a glimpse into the wider scope. Join me in exploring the blend of technology and creativity as we bridge the digital and real worlds.
